# BUOY DETECTION PROJECT

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting buoys using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built in Google Colab. The primary objective is to identify and classify buoys from a dataset of images, which can be useful for marine navigation, autonomous systems, and surveillance. The repository includes Jupyter notebooks for dataset creation and CNN model training, along with a dataset of buoy images.
Repository Structure
1.	30114165_creating_dataset.ipynb: Notebook for loading, preprocessing, and augmenting the buoy image dataset.
2.	30114165_CNN_Buoy_Detection.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for building, training, and evaluating a CNN model for buoy detection.
3.	buoy_dataset.zip: A compressed file containing the buoy image dataset.

## Requirements

This project runs in Google Colab, which has most of the dependencies pre-installed. However, if you're running it locally, you'll need:
1.	Python 3.x
2.	Jupyter Notebook
3.	TensorFlow or PyTorch 
4.	NumPy
5.	OpenCV
6.	Matplotlib
7.	Scikit-learn
Install any missing dependencies using:

```py
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python matplotlib scikit-learn
```
Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
```py
 git clone https://github.com/your-repo/buoy-detection.git
```
2. Open the Google Colab notebooks:
1.	Upload the notebooks `30114165_creating_dataset.ipynb` and `30114165_CNN_Buoy_Detection.ipynb` to Google Colab.
2.	Upload the dataset by unzipping `buoy_dataset.zip` into a folder in your Colab environment.
3. Dataset Preparation:
1.	Open `30114165_creating_dataset.ipynb` in Colab to load and preprocess the dataset.
4. Model Training:
1Open `30114165_CNN_Buoy_Detection.ipynb` in Colab and follow the steps to train and evaluate the CNN model.
2.	Execute each cell sequentially to run the model on the buoy dataset.
